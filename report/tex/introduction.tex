\section{Introduction}

Epilepsy is a neurological condition predominantly characterized by the protracted recurrence of
seizures.
% Imagine a neuron singing on a stage, but with a microphone that is too sensitive. Picking up the
% speaker, it produces an awful feedback sound. It is the same as what happens during a epileptic
% seizure.
It is one of the most common neurological diseases worldwide \cute{vos2016global},
making it an important target for research. One of the research avenues focus on mutations of the
SCNA1 gene, coding for sodium channels. In this project, we have focused on two of these mutations,
Q1489K and L1649Q.

%% Introduce epilepsy
% Imagine a neuron on a stage playing a guitar, with microphone that is too sensitive. Picking
% up the  speaker, it produces an awful feedback sound. It is the same that happens during an
% epileptic seizure. Epilepsy is a neurological condition predominantly characterized by the
% protracted recurrence of seizures. In 2015, 39.2 million people suffered from epilepsy worldwide,
% making it one of the most common ailments \cite{vos2016global}. Therefore, further research must be
% conducted to understand the mechanism through which epileptic seizures manifest for the future
% development of targeted therapeutics.

% Talk about mutations
% One avenue of research has focused on the SCNA1 gene, a sodium channel gene
% with a history of mutations associated with epilepsy. For instance, mutants exhibit subtle
% differences in voltage-gated sodium ion channel density along the cellular membrane. These changes
% in channel density have been thought to underlie the physiological disturbance that results in
% abnormal neurological functioning found in epilepsy.

% Here, we utilised two previously developed
% models of SCNA1 mutations, the Q1489K and L1649Q variants, to gain a greater understanding of the
% specific downstream cellular signalling mechanisms that are affected by changing the density of
% mutated membrane sodium channels.

% TODO: I like this paragraph. Can we keep it???? No, we cannot
% By a suitable change of parameters in the compartmental pyramidal layer 5 cell model (L5PC)
% \cite{hay2011models}, altered neuron spiking due to two SCN1A mutations was characterised
% separately.  Affected and unaffected networks were subsequently simulated in order to ascertain the
% effect of the mutation. Parameters found by a fit to the single neuron frequency-current (f-I) curve
% were used to encode the presence of mutated channels in the network setting. Neuron network dynamics
% were investigated by a network model of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, using the
% parameter-fitted integrate and fire model for computational efficiency.

% Mutations can cause a network of neurons are a bit too sensitive to stimulation,
% and end up creating a positive feed back loop, stimulating each other, causing an epileptic seizure.

% A correlation has been shown to exist between several genetic variants affecting ion channels in
% neurons and instances of diseases such as familial migraine, epilepsy and schizophrenia
% \cite{vanmolkot2007novel,escayg2010sodium,maki2016functional}.
